/***********************
 * UnintendedUsageWarnings
 * 
 * A Java class written by Erymanthus / RayDeeUx as a means to minimize instances of unintentionally loading
 * the RawInput mod in Minecraft instances outside of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
 * An additional check is included to detect a SkyClient instance specifically to complement the soon-to-be
 * (as of time of writing) plan to add a warning for users not on Windows who attempt to select the RawInput
 * mod in the SkyClient installer, as folks who can't read are probably going to go out of their way to sneak
 * the RawInput mod into their SkyClient installation despite those warnings.
 * 
 * We truly are living in the future, folks.
